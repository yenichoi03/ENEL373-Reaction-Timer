The project milestone involves measuring and displaying a user's reaction time. A reaction timer has been created and consists of 4 program specifications to support the final project, namely these are:

1. The program should prompt the user by means of three lit decimal points on the seven-segment array that turn off sequentially.
2. When the last decimal point turns off a timer should start and run until the centre push button, BTNC, is pressed.
3. Once the button press is received the elapsed time (in milliseconds) should be stored and display on the seven-segment array.
4. Pressing BTNC again should clear the seven-segment displays and restart the prompting sequence so that another reaction test can begin.
