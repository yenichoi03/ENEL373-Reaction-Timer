-- BUGS --


-- TO DO --
* Random number stuff
* need to tidy things but I am afraid to touch anything in the big modules
*Make PRNG more consistent



EMILY (4/04/24):

-- NEW CHANGES --
* Shift reg has a reset line
* Error message has a lil o




MARCUS():
Connected FSM to PRNG


YENI():
ALU division, subtraction and comparison would be good to do in integers. The difficult bit is converting the int into BCD.
I will work on the ALU functions. 

--CURRENT MODULES--

* CLOCK DIVIDER x2
* DISPLAY COUNTER (digit select)
* DECODER (anode select)
* MUX
* BCD TO 7 SEG (cathode select)
* DECADE COUNTER x4
* FSM (dot_3, dot_2, dot_1, counting, calculating, print_current_time, print_best_time, print_worst_time, print_average_time)
* ALU
* 16bit REGISTER x3
*PRNG
