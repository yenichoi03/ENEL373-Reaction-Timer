-- BUGS --
* We're getting various weird display flickers and idk where they're from
* The result is not updating. I believe this is related to the ALU calc not being triggerd. Note that currently two of the states have hard coded 4444 and 2222 values showing just to check that the fsm state was changing. the other one SHOULD be showing the worst time.

-- TO DO --
* Display codes for indicating Fastest, Slowest, Average (F, S, A)
* Random number stuff


EMILY (4/04/24):

-- NEW CHANGES --
* Finished the two converters
* Created testbenches for the two converters
* Linked the converters and ALU into the main program and FSM

-- THOUGHTS --
* Naming of things feels a bit confusing? should maybe try and clean up
* Yeni's file wasn't linked in properly (git issues) so I just duplicated it 




MARCUS():


YENI():
ALU division, subtraction and comparison would be good to do in integers. The difficult bit is converting the int into BCD.
I will work on the ALU functions. 

--CURRENT MODULES--

* CLOCK DIVIDER x2
* DISPLAY COUNTER (digit select)
* DECODER (anode select)
* MUX
* BCD TO 7 SEG (cathode select)
* DECADE COUNTER x4
* FSM (dot_3, dot_2, dot_1, counting, calculating, print_current_time, print_best_time, print_worst_time, print_average_time)
* ALU
* 16bit REGISTER x3
