-- BUGS --
* Select line is not cycling properly
* there is a separate bug with storing the actual times (not coming through properly from curent time?), currently set to constnats for select debugging
* New display bug when showing dots
*Error Message a bit odd

-- TO DO --
* Random number stuff
* Left button needs to clear all stored times


EMILY (4/04/24):

-- NEW CHANGES --
* Added a storage select line into the fsm source code
* ALU calculations all working properly and triggerng properly

-- THOUGHTS --
* Naming of things feels a bit confusing? should maybe try and clean up




MARCUS():
Added Error message, the display isn't quite right. Worked on int storage


YENI():
ALU division, subtraction and comparison would be good to do in integers. The difficult bit is converting the int into BCD.
I will work on the ALU functions. 

--CURRENT MODULES--

* CLOCK DIVIDER x2
* DISPLAY COUNTER (digit select)
* DECODER (anode select)
* MUX
* BCD TO 7 SEG (cathode select)
* DECADE COUNTER x4
* FSM (dot_3, dot_2, dot_1, counting, calculating, print_current_time, print_best_time, print_worst_time, print_average_time)
* ALU
* 16bit REGISTER x3
