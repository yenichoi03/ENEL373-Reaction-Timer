-- BUGS --
* BCD to integer conversion in the shift register -- currently only using thousands value as an interim debugging measure
* various display bugs, showing rs for dots?
*Error Message a bit odd
* Average symbol is a 9??

-- TO DO --
* Random number stuff
* Left button needs to clear all stored times
* need to tidy things but I am afraid to touch anything in the big modules


EMILY (4/04/24):

-- NEW CHANGES --
* Created a shift register to replace the int-storage module cause that was being a bitch
* ALU calculations all working properly and triggerng properly




MARCUS():
Added Error message, the display isn't quite right. Worked on int storage


YENI():
ALU division, subtraction and comparison would be good to do in integers. The difficult bit is converting the int into BCD.
I will work on the ALU functions. 

--CURRENT MODULES--

* CLOCK DIVIDER x2
* DISPLAY COUNTER (digit select)
* DECODER (anode select)
* MUX
* BCD TO 7 SEG (cathode select)
* DECADE COUNTER x4
* FSM (dot_3, dot_2, dot_1, counting, calculating, print_current_time, print_best_time, print_worst_time, print_average_time)
* ALU
* 16bit REGISTER x3
